# FDX Test Suite Summary

## Overview

I've created a comprehensive, unified test suite for fdx with the following improvements:

### New Test Files Created

1. **`conftest.py`** - Shared pytest fixtures and helper functions
2. **`test_diff_operator.py`** - 280+ lines of tests for Diff operator
3. **`test_gradient_comprehensive.py`** - 320+ lines of tests for Gradient
4. **`test_divergence_curl_laplacian.py`** - 375+ lines of tests for vector operators
5. **`test_grids_comprehensive.py`** - 175+ lines of tests for grid functionality
6. **`test_coefs_comprehensive.py`** - 255+ lines of tests for coefficients
7. **`test_findiff_compat.py`** - 265+ lines of tests for FinDiff compatibility
8. **`test_properties_hypothesis.py`** - 385+ lines of property-based tests
9. **`README.md`** - Comprehensive documentation for the test suite

## Test Structure

### Unified Organization

All tests follow a consistent structure:

- **Class-based organization**: Tests grouped by functionality
- **Descriptive naming**: `Test<Feature><Aspect>` pattern
- **Comprehensive docstrings**: Every test explains what it tests
- **Fixtures**: Shared test data in `conftest.py`

### Test Categories

Each test file includes:

1. **Basic Tests**: Functionality and creation
2. **Polynomial Tests**: Derivatives of polynomial functions
3. **Trigonometric Tests**: Sin/cos derivatives
4. **Multidimensional Tests**: 1D, 2D, 3D operations
5. **Edge Cases**: Boundary conditions and special cases
6. **Accuracy Tests**: Convergence properties
7. **Property-Based Tests**: Mathematical properties using Hypothesis

## Features

### Property-Based Testing with Hypothesis

- Tests mathematical properties rather than specific values
- Automatic test case generation
- Better coverage than hand-written examples
- Properties tested:
  - Linearity: `D(af + bg) = aD(f) + bD(g)`
  - Power rule: `d/dx(x^n) = nx^(n-1)`
  - Trigonometric identities
  - Vector calculus identities

### Parametrized Tests

- Multiple accuracy orders: [2, 4, 6, 8]
- Various derivative orders: [1, 2, 3, 4]
- Different grid sizes and functions
- Automatic test generation for combinations

### Shared Fixtures

- 1D, 2D, 3D grids in various sizes
- Small grids for fast tests
- Medium/large grids for accuracy tests
- Tolerance calculation based on accuracy order
