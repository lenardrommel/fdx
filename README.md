# Finite Differences in JAX - fdx

## About

This software is based on the [findiff library](https://findiff.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) by M. Baer (2018) and their great work. You can find the original implementation [here](https://github.com/maroba/findiff/tree/master).

While this package doesn't include all features from the original library, it focuses on providing high test coverage and essential functionality for finite difference computations in JAX. Please note that as this serves as a specialized tool for research purposes, maintenance may be limited.

## Features

- JAX-compatible implementation for finite difference computations
- High-performance finite difference operations
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Clean, maintainable codebase

## Limitations

This is a research-focused implementation with limited maintenance capacity. For production use cases requiring extensive features, consider the original findiff library.
